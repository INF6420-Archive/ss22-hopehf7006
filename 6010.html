  <b>Joint Archives of Holland</b>
    <p>The Joint Archives of Holland is a department of the Van Wylen Library of Hope College, in Holland, Michigan. Founded in 1988, it was named for the two collections it houses, that of Hope College and its staff and students, as well as that of the Western Theological Seminary and the Reformed Church of America (RCA). As a resident of Holland, I was interested in this local archive as soon as it appeared in the list of “libraries near me.” I did not attend Hope College, so I was unaware of the existence of the Joint Archives. </p>
    <p>Before its official founding, Hope College employed a part-time archivist (Janet Mulder, 1952-1968) whose work was continued by the volunteered efforts of an assistant Religion professor (Elton Bruins, 1967-1988) before another part-time archivist was found (Andrew VanderZee, 1970-1988). In 1976, those managing the archives housed by Hope College, Western Theological Seminary, and the Holland Museum proposed unifying their collection, employing a full-time professional archive position as well as a flood- and fire-proof repository for the materials. This proposal failed to be passed due to a lack of funds and failed again in 1980 for similar reasons.  </p>
    <p>Finally, in 1987, the three collections became one under Larry Wagenaar and were relocated to an official archival space in the Van Wylen Library. The staff expanded to include a Collections Manager in 1990, as well as an Office Manager in 1996. In 1997, the Joint Archives launched their website, which would go on to become a major part of patrons’ usage. The current archivist, Geoff Reynolds, was promoted to that position in 2001 after serving as Collections Manager, a position that was then eliminated. In that same year, the Holland Museum chose to remove their collection from the Joint Archives, a somewhat painful separation. The archives moved to the free-standing two-story Henri and Eleanor Theil Research Center in 2004, allowing for more storage and a workroom for processing. </p>
    <p>As the sole professional archivist at the Joint Archives, Geoff depends heavily on his staff. The office manager, Lori Trethewey, functions as the front-line reference librarian, fielding requests and answering all those she can before sending the harder or more involved queries to Geoff. The student interns play a huge role in the running of the archives as well, whether they work with preservation and digitalization or run the front desk. Roughly half of reference questions are submitted by email, and many of the in-person visits are made up of classes coming all at once, making for a much quieter space than it was in the past. Geoff noted that about half of the remote reference work is local, while the rest is from across the nation (G. Reynolds, personal interview, June 18, 2020). The fact that the materials themselves are almost all available on the website lends itself to even those on campus sending an email when they run into an issue. </p>
    <p>The two collections include documents from the college and seminary, the staff and alumni. The Joint Archives also houses materials from certain RCA churches, as the official RCA archive is in New Jersey and many prefer to keep the items locally. Those doing mission work through the RCA often donate their letters and personal items, as the New Jersey archive limits their collection to official missional reports. These items have some of the most valuable information, giving researchers a front seat to things the missionaries did not necessarily mean to disclose: an insider’s view of church politics, an outsider’s view of national histories, and a lay person’s view of environmental conditions. The oldest items in the archive’s collection date to 1846, when Dutch immigrants first established the colony that would eventually become the city of Holland. Geoff estimates that the collection is 80% physical documents, 20% video, and 10% photo. </p>
    <p>The Archives have gone through fairly major changes with regards to its daily operations. Of course, as technology changed, so too did their method of sharing their collection. The dissolution of the position of Collections Manager has meant more work for Geoff, Lori, and the interns. At the same time, things have become a little simpler due to an increase in funding. The salary for the office manager was formerly only half-covered through the college, and Geoff spent two full days working for local companies Meijer and Amway at their respective offices. While the work was not too taxing, and at the time it was very necessary, it kept Geoff from being able to focus completely on the state of the archives. Then, a longtime patron of the Archives, Mary Riepma Ross, left an endowment in her will to completely fund the director’s position. This allowed Geoff to spend his complete workweek at the Archives, as well as giving him a travel stipend to enrich his knowledge. </p>
    <p>Geoff noted that they are also looking forward to change. Having worked at the Archives since 1997, he is anticipating his retirement in the next two years. Before that time, he plans to complete the project of writing a schedule for their records management. While records management has been a part of the operations at the Archives for many years, it has not been solidified with an official schedule, which enables the future archivist and those using the service to be confident in the preservation of the materials. Additionally, they are still working from a catalog system created by a student many years ago, which has become clunky and outdated. The move to ArchivesSpace should happen in the next year, and Geoff is very eager for that to be completed. </p>
    <p>As an archive that is closely connected to the institutions whose documents they store, the Joint Archives must follow the restrictions they have set for access. All internal church documents held in their collection have a 20-year waiting period. Hope College documents also have 20-year restrictions placed on them, except for the meeting notes, which have an even longer restriction of 40 years. These waiting periods ensure that accessing these materials do not fuel any current arguments within the RCA or Hope community, but Geoff noted that to his mind, they are somewhat extreme. On the other hand, he has never had a disagreement with the College or the Seminary about what he has allowed patrons to access, and the President is able to approve any unsealing that he might feel was necessary. </p>
    <p>When it comes to fees, the Joint Archives do not consider them important to the running or future of their collection. They only charge fees for commercial photo use, asking news conglomerates to pay $100 for use and businesses creating billboards to pay $20. For any other use, the only requirement is that a courtesy line is included so that those interacting with the photo are aware of its origin. This stance on fees has influenced their neighboring institution, the Holland Museum, who likewise has done away with most fees. Geoff reflected on the current state of data, noting that while fees may be useful for funding, that funding does little if no one knows about your collection. In a world where data is so freely available, the best way for the Joint Archives to thrive is to spread information about it, rather than raise funds. I think for an academic archive, this is especially valid. They are in a more secure situation, being able to depend on their college, as well as possibly being more concerned with scholarship and learning rather than capital gains than their private counterparts. </p>
    <p>This is not to claim that an academic archive is free of any concerns other than the pure pursuit of maintaining and promoting their collection. As mentioned earlier, the Joint Archives were formerly made up of three collections. The Holland Museum chose to remove their materials from the Joint Archives and hold them in their own archival space in 2001. This was clearly a messy separation, although Geoff did not share all the details. It sounded as though there was a disagreement between the former directors of the Archives and the Museum, something more personally motivated than policy driven. For a while, the two institutions politely ignored each other, but as time passed on and new directors stepped into the roles, they began working together again. Eventually, the Holland Museum invited Geoff to join their Board of Directors. While it seems to me that the wounds have been healed from this dramatic fight, it reveals that no matter what you have as your mission statement, keeping your motivation free of ego is a daily choice. </p>
    <p>I have almost no experience with archives, so I learned a lot during this interview, both about the Joint Archives specifically and about general realities and trends within the field. I think the Joint Archives have flourished in the Internet Age, which connected them to patrons who would not have known about them or been able to access the collection otherwise. The website reflects how much they have embraced the digital aspect of archives, which is probably the only way to stay relevant. I appreciated how much Geoff was focused on the quality of storage and dissemination of the collection, rather than the profitability or the size of the Archives. It sounded like a homey kind of place to work, either as an intern or as a researcher. Geoff clearly loves all aspects of archival work, although he confessed that he did not plan on becoming a director. As he was formerly a teacher, I wonder if he was drawn to archives not only for the great variety in tasks, but also because it offered a more precise item-focused world than the often chaotic child-focused world of the classroom. From how much he mentioned the difficulty in dealing with others, I started to think that interpersonal skills were something he had to nurture rather than something he had naturally. Yet in our interview, he was incredibly personable, open about all aspects of his job, and even told me I was welcome to do some interning there myself. If it is something he has had to teach himself, he has done a wonderful job of it. </p>
    <p>Even though Geoff did not really focus on it, I noticed there were some signs that the Archives might be slightly underappreciated. While he himself seemed very happy with his position in general, he mentioned that their catalog was massively out of date, that he used to report to the provost and now is below the dean of the library, and that the professors do not “return the favor” by recommending their students to pursue MLIS in graduate school. This made me wonder if archive work is especially one in which you must find your own fulfilment and learn to accept that those in power will not understand or even value the work you do for them. Having been in that position before, I’m unsurprised that Geoff recommends looking into the cutting-edge parts of archival work, metadata and digital scholarship. As much as I don’t believe in choosing a career to get the most money, well-paid positions are often the most well-respected, and that certainly makes coming in every day easier. I don’t imagine those who are not very interested in the work itself being able to last long. </p>
    <p>I think I would enjoy working at the Joint Archives. It is unlikely that they would employ another full-time archivist, as they haven’t had one for almost 20 years, but I may take up Geoff on his offer to intern a little. It is on the small side, which I think helps it to keep the quality of cataloging and preservation high, as well as the quality of patron assistance. I also like the idea that you would spend your time moving from task to task, taking on problems as they arise, learning bit by bit. As an academic archive, and from how Geoff described it, the Joint Archives would be unlikely to expect instant mastery. Since Geoff is planning to retire very soon, they will be on the lookout for a new director. However, I don’t think I would be a good fit, even if I had graduated by then. It really would need someone with a lot of experience, who can instruct and supervise the interns and be comfortable being the one with the ultimate responsibility for the safety of the materials, as well as the treatment of the patrons. I think I would have to have several years of archive work under my belt, specifically at the Archives if I were really to succeed. </p>
    <p>Geoff advises new information professionals not to limit themselves to pursuing traditional archiving. He notes that the most successful of the interns that went on to graduate school are those that focused on metadata and digital scholarship. In addition to being a quickly growing field, these positions were hardly affected at all by the pandemic. Their work stayed steady despite physical locations being closed. They also get to explore new areas of archiving, basically creating the position that they fill. At the same time, Geoff noted that it does not benefit the librarian, or the library in which they work, if they are not interested in what they are doing. He also recommended academic archives, saying that West Michigan was a great place to find opportunity for employment. Not only do archives connected to colleges offer excellent benefits and security, they also encourage their archivists to focus on scholarship and learning new things. Regardless of what kind of archive or library one might work at, Geoff emphasized that communication skills are vitally important. “There’s more HR-related things than you might think,” he cautioned. Even as an archivist who sticks to processing and management, preferring to avoid the patrons, one will still have to understand their supervisors, coworkers, and employees. Being able to build relationships with your fellow workers or patrons and to navigate awkward conversations will enable you to maintain a healthy archive. </p>
    <p>As Geoff’s staff is limited to student interns who eventually graduate, he has a lot of experience looking at a resume and deciding whether to hire them. Yet he also is working from a smaller field of applicants than someone hiring full-time employees. When he is considering a new hire, he looks for someone who will be able to handle the two largest and most disparate parts of an archivist’s work: processing and communicating. Someone who can interact with patrons in a warm, welcoming way, while also being able to focus on the items and organize them well is the ideal candidate. Most of the time, the interns at the Joint Archives excel at or prefer one specific part of the job, running the front desk, organizing materials, writing for the newsletter, or even simply scanning items that need to be recorded. Geoff has had mostly positive experiences with his interns, perhaps in part because he always keeps in mind that they are begin with little to no knowledge or experience. He encourages them to try anything they wish to, without hampering them, from the point of view that this is the best place for them to learn. “You can’t really screw anything up in an archive unless you burn it or cut it,” he told me with a laugh. </p>
    <p>Since the Joint Archives are currently closed, Geoff was a bit nostalgic about his work there. It was difficult for him to be doing only remote work, as the variety of tasks there is one of his favorite parts of his job. He enjoys moving from helping patrons at the front desk to answering complicated reference questions to traveling to Virtual Records Control to deliver oversized items that need to be scanned. He even reminisced about being asked questions that he’s answered hundreds of times before. Although he has never been a part of a very large archive, he cannot imagine that he would have liked it as much as being the director of his “small shop,” which allows him to gain some experience in every part of maintaining the Joint Archives. In a non-academic institution with many archivists, he posited that he would feel like just another cog in the machine and spend time competing with his coworkers. It is true that from his perspective, neither the dean of the library nor the provost really understands how archives work, but he accepts this as something that most directors likely feel. </p>
    <p>The biggest challenge and the most rewarding part of being the director of the Archives is the same thing: the people. Interns do not always pan out, leading Geoff and his office manager Lori to have to micromanage them or metaphorically stick them in a corner where they do the least harm. It seemed to me that perhaps they were discouraged at the Archives from firing their interns or letting them go. Even between Geoff and Lori, there are tensions that must be teased out, something neither one especially enjoys. Though bittersweet, seeing former interns go on to graduate school and succeed as an archivist is Geoff’s greatest pride. He spoke of many different interns throughout our interview, and it was clear that he loved being able to spark the interest in archivist work and library sciences in them. He even mentioned that he had a specific former intern that he would like to take over as the director once he retires. </p>
<b>Patmos Library</b>
  <p>Patmos Library is located in Jamestown Township (Hudsonville), Michigan. I have been to many of the libraries of West Michigan but have not visited this one. It was only after I arranged for the interview that I learned that it is my sister and brother-in-law's local library, which they love! This made me even happier that I could learn more about it. </p>
  <p>Originally another branch of my childhood library, Herrick District Library, Patmos Library as its own entity began in 1998, when voters approved a $1.8 million millage and Marv and June Patmos, owners of Sunrise Acres Egg Farms and Patmos Feed and Grain, donated an additional $1 million. The location, formerly the home of the trolley depot, was also donated, by Fannie DeKleine. Since then it has become a beloved part of its community. </p>
  <p>Amber McLain has only recently become the director after serving as the children’s librarian for two years. A graduate of Wayne State University, she was not expecting to become the director, but was chosen after serving as interim director. Amber said she prefers to have the library staff work as a team, rather than emphasize hierarchy (A. McLain, personal interview, June 29, 2020). The former director had a habit of only doing “director work,” and leaving the day-to-day tasks of library work to the rest of the librarians, which did not create a healthy or happy work environment. In the same way, the Board of Trustees is largely hands-off with the running of the library, requiring Amber to get their approval only for policy changes and high-level disciplinary actions for staff, such as suspensions or firings. </p>
  <p>Besides their Adult and Youth Departments and a small archive of local history, Patmos Library also has a puzzle and game board collection. Amber explained that she was trying to develop a video game collection, which would undoubtedly be used within the library as well, as the Teen Room features an XBox. These collections befit a library with a high percentage of young families and seniors as their patrons. While seniors are more likely to be interested in genealogy and perhaps puzzles, board games and video games are great for children of all ages. Most of their programming is also geared towards their young patrons, such as their Summer Reading Program and Early Literacy Program. Both programs normally have two to three events per week. The Early Literacy Program usually features story time as well as a music-based event. Patmos Library promotes 1000 Books Before Kindergarten. The Technology Programs at Patmos have included Coding for Kids and Technology Take Aparts, where kids have the chance to take a piece of technology apart to inspect it. Other programming that has continued through the pandemic are Music & Movement, Podcast Thursday, and one-offs like a take-home animal craft, how to build a terrarium, and a Zoom cooking class. </p>
  <p>There are some usage restrictions at Patmos Library. They receive the E-Rate and Hot Spots grants, which require the internet access to fall within CIPA guidelines. Amber specified that they had blocked things like gambling and other “adult sites." I have understood that all that a library is required to block would be images considered inappropriate for children due to featuring gore and violence or being sexually explicit, but I also know that most libraries tend to over-block in order not to risk losing their grants. </p>
  <p>They also have printing fees and overdue fines, as well as rental fees to use the Depot Room. Printing color sheets is $0.40 per page, while those in black-and-white cost $0.15 per page. Overdue fines accrue daily, $1 for DVDs and other special collection items like Launchpads, $0.15 for books and audiobooks. Amber added that she has been asking the Board to reconsider their policy on fines, as she is aware that is affects accessibility and makes up a very small part of their budget. As I also use a Lakeland Library Collaborative collection and recognized those fines, I asked if that was something the Collaborative dictated. Amber clarified that while she believed this was something the directors of the libraries involved had agreed to in the past, Patmos Library is not required to charge fines. They also receive rental fees from those wishing to make use of their Depot Room. This includes $75 to rent with a $100 deposit that is returned based on the condition of the room and the nearby restrooms. There is also a $25 fee for those that chose to use any audio-visual equipment. For teachers whose classes are using the library for a classroom project, both the rental fee and deposit are waived. </p>
  <p>The Teen Room is a separate area for teens (ages 12-18) to use within the library. It is equipped with a television and an XBox and is where the board game collection is kept. While the Teen Room does not need to be rented or reserved, the teens need to sign up at the Circulation Desk and retrieve the remotes there if they are interested in using the television and the XBox. Food and drink are allowed, and the teens may watch a DVD there provided an adult has checked it out for them. For the time being, they will need to bring their own XBox games if they are interested in playing video games, but that is also allowed. The door is kept open unless a librarian decides to close it, in cases of a DVD being watched or a game being played. If the teens become disruptive or act inappropriately, fail to clean up the room after their use, or break anything within the room, they risk losing Teen Room privileges. I really like the idea of having a space just for teens, who are sometimes overlooked among the youth.  </p>
  <p>There is also a children’s area at Patmos Library. Separated by half-walls and filled with child-sized tables, chairs, and interactive areas, it is a welcoming area that allows parents to supervise from a distance. The walls are painted with chalkboard paint, further encouraging creativity. </p>
  <p>Growing up using the Main Branch of the Herrick District Library, the Patmos Library seems small but very cozy. I really liked the layout of the library, from the Circulation Desk to the children’s area. Although they may not have the space or the collection that a large library has, they make great use of their building and because of the Lakeland Library Collaborative, their patrons have access to basically all the materials that I had. </p>
  <p>Amber left me with the feeling that the library was kind of recovering after a subpar director left. Though she did not explain the circumstances of her serving as interim director, it certainly sounds like something out of the ordinary occurred. While I am still very eager to work at a public library, I think it was a good reminder that things may not be perfect. Wherever I end up, I will have to navigate having a boss. Directors might fall into the position without really being suited to it, while others may have become overly attached to the status quo or worse, tired of being a part of a library yet unwilling to change careers. Patmos Library is in the process of growing back into vibrancy, so that gives me hope, but I am glad that Amber was open enough with their situation that my vision of working in a library can be more realistic and less rose-tinted. </p>
  <p>Through our interview and looking at the Patmos Library website, it became very clear that the library truly takes its mission seriously. They are extremely patron- and community-focused. Amber and her staff did not take being closed as a chance to take it easy but seemed to have worked even harder to create ways to connect to their patrons. Amber mentioned that they were taking it one day at a time, which can imply a slow-moving process, but I think they were viewing the present day as reality, rather than attempting to hold onto the way things used to be or focusing on a hypothetical future return of “normal.” They have a huge list of resources specifically to continue exploration and learning through the COVID pandemic, such as a collection of aquariums offering live webcams, crafts, exercise, games, and mental health resources. </p>
  <p>I think I would like to work at Patmos Library. Obviously, it is close to family, which is something I would like to have (though not a requirement) when I graduate. I can tell that Amber is passionate about librarianship, specifically about community, which I would love to have in a director. She also has put a huge emphasis on being a caring and open boss. Having had numerous lackluster supervisors in my life, I know that it makes a huge difference when you can trust and respect the person who is leading you. I also foresee further growth, if not in size, then simply in number of programs and quality of service. I sadly cannot fill either of their open positions having just begun my studies and certainly would not wish them to remain vacant for too long. However, if they are again seeking applicants when I graduate, I would not hesitate to send in my resume. </p>
  <p>Amber only graduated from Wayne State University two years ago, and her advice to new informational professionals was colored by her experience as well as that of her peers. She encouraged them to keep trying, saying that the field was growing even if it might not look like it. Amber also advised that those seeking a position should keep their options open. Working in circulation may not be your first choice, but it might lead to something better in the future than what you can currently find. Taking a position that offers growth is the best choice. Amber also came back to the topic of leadership and how important it is as a director to listen to your staff and to work in every aspect of the library.  </p>
  <p>When looking at a new hire, Amber looks for the ability to learn new technology and good customer service skills. She specified that it did not matter as much how much technology they were familiar with, as long as they would be able to catch on and eager to do so. Librarianship is very similar to customer service, with overlaps in aspects such as welcoming visitors into the space while not overwhelming them, helping patrons find what they are looking for, and knowing how to problem-solve on the fly. Amber also is drawn to those who are open communicators. Just as Geoff has found, no matter what field you are in, being able to maintain a healthy relationship with your coworkers is instrumental to the overall health of the business or institution. </p>
  <p>As I alluded to earlier, Patmos Library is undergoing changes. Amber listed being able to make those changes happen as her favorite thing about being director. When she served as the children’s librarian, Amber was able to get to know the community well and has used this to create a space that serves it well. A helper by nature, Amber also loves the fact that as the director, she has the power to help others, both patrons and the library staff. The staff is very important to Amber. She enjoys their meetings and casual interactions in which they bounce ideas off each other and brainstorm together. As the director, Amber spends her time preparing budgets and speaking with the Board, as well as assisting in checkout, shelving books, and planning the programming. The variety of her work is another thing Amber enjoys about the position. The support of the Board of Trustees and her fellow directors at Lakeland Library Collective have helped smooth the transition. Now that she is the director, she sometimes has days that can put a lot of pressure on her, as she is the one ultimately responsible. </p>
  <p>Amber’s largest challenge is that she did not aim or plan to become a director of a library. When she was taking classes, her focus was on data analytics and children’s librarianship. The management of a library was not something she had studied, and so parts of the job that are director-specific, such as budgeting, were things she was forced to learn on the fly. Especially when she was the interim director, she had to seek help a lot. Still, Amber was able to succeed, as she has no problem admitting when she does not know the answer. The most rewarding part of her job is that the patrons have asked, “Who is responsible for these improvements to the library?” and she is able to answer that she was the one who made those changes. The Township Board also made a point to applaud her work, which meant a lot to her as well. </p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
  <p>These interviews have taught me a lot. I have a much fuller picture of the reality of being a librarian: that is not always easy, that people will be the best yet hardest part of the job, that I am unlikely to regret pursuing my dream. I also have the beginning of an awareness of how much current librarians want future librarians to succeed, which has helped me gain confidence and resolve to keep at it. </p>
