<h1 class="greeting">From Compliance to Centering: Public Libraries and People with Disabilities</h1>

<b>Introduction</b>
    <p>Libraries pride themselves as being one of the first institutions to recognize people with disabilities as equal members of the community. “The commitment to equity and access for people with disabilities was embraced among libraries long before it became a consideration for most other organizations and institutions,” Jaeger et al. (2015) declare (p. 2), and it is true that the history of the American Library Association includes many high points such as the 1906 foundation of the Committee for Library Work with the Blind and the 1961 creation of standards working to ensure equal service to patrons with disabilities. However, this history does not mean that the work is done, nor is it proof public libraries have never made mistakes regarding the treatment of people with disabilities. Instead, this history should spur them to continue to learn and grow in their pursuit of accessibility for all, reminding librarians how vital it is to prioritize the needs of those with disabilities. Libraries should not congratulate themselves for complying with the ADA and consider the matter settled, but instead should seek to center the knowledge and experience of people with disabilities in all their plans. </p>
<b>Building Accessibility </b>
    <p>While libraries have a history of serving people with disabilities that goes back to the 1800s, requirements changed for libraries, as well as many other institutions, with the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990. Libraries, along with many other institutions, now had a concrete list of mandates aimed at protecting the rights of people with disabilities. Many libraries immediately embraced these requirements, even using them as a springboard for greater inclusion. For example, the Montclair Public Library of New Jersey expanded and renovated their library building from 1996-97 in order to include “push-button entry doors, a super-sized elevator, wide doorways, a ramp on the two-level children's floor, and accessible rest rooms” but considered that only a first step (Hutchinson, 2001, p. 26). Two years later, they prioritized an expansion of services to people with disabilities, from purchasing new technology to offering ASL interpretation at their events.  </p>
    <p>However, other libraries did not respond to this new requirement so eagerly. Because noncompliant buildings are most often brought to the notice of the government through lawsuits, it is very difficult to say how many libraries across the country are not fully compliant with the ADA. There has been a trend in university libraries coming under fire for their lack of compliance, but they might be receiving more notice than public libraries “because of their substantial digital footprint and their centrality in the educational process” (Kimura, 2018, p. 426). It is likely that the same issues exist for both academic, public, and special libraries. Coleman (2012), in their work to discover the best course of action for the Brimfield Public Library to have an ADA-compliant library building, interviewed eight other small-town Massachusetts libraries about the accessibility of their building. Although this is a very small sample, half of the libraries self-reported that they were not fully compliant, giving answers such as “No,” “Yes, but did not pass ABA inspection,” “‘Making reasonable efforts,’ using the first floor only,” and “Some accommodations made, no restroom” (Coleman, 2012, Table 3). Three of these libraries had plans to build a new library, but it is unclear whether these plans would result in full compliance. The ADA generously allows requirements which “result in an ‘undue burden’” to be waived (American Library Association, 2001), undoubtedly creating a loophole for libraries faced with the cost of renovating to stay compliant with the regularly updated ADA and a perpetually shrinking budget. Unless and until a lawsuit is brought against them, these libraries may carry on offering the bare minimum in accessibility to their patrons. While ADA compliance is not a complete fulfillment of equitable access, libraries cannot move forward unless this first step is accomplished. </p>
<b>Digital Accessibility</b>
    <p>In addition to building compliance, libraries also need to consider the accessibility of their digital materials. The internet was almost entirely text-based at its inception, which made it quite simple to navigate for people with disabilities, such as those with limited sight who made use of voice software. However, as the internet has become more expansive and more varied, it has also become less text based. As Valerie Lewis, a blind librarian, explains:
    <blockquote>With the increased use of graphics, keyboard commands became beveled buttons or cute icons that could be activated with a click. Boring backgrounds became whimsical wallpapers. Important messages could blink or scroll across the screen. The Web became user-friendly. Unfortunately, this user-friendly Web was not very friendly to me. (Lewis & Klauber, 2002)</blockquote> 
    Libraries should be creating webpages that are accessible to all, as well as inspecting the sites they partner with for accessibility. While there are tests for compliance that libraries can make use of, they suffer from a limited focus and are made even less useful when run by a person who is not disabled (Kimura, 2018, p. 430; Kumbier & Starkey, 2016, p.479). The best way to ensure the digital materials a library offers are accessible is to rely on the knowledge and experience of people with disabilities and take their suggestions seriously.  </p>
<b>Training and Research</b>
    <p>Librarians must keep in mind the need for specialized training and research in order to have a better understanding of the concerns of patrons with disabilities. Over the years, institutions have struggled to keep the knowledge and experience of people with disabilities at the forefront of training and research, instead relying on the opinions of able-bodied “experts.” Libraries are unfortunately no exception here. For instance, when the Ohio LSTA Advisory Council formed a task force to address “disability issues,” it comprised of “librarians who work with the disabled, librarians who have applied for LSTA grants to serve the disabled, and representatives of organizations that work with the disabled,” but Lodge (2004) makes no mention of any members having a disability themselves. Part of the training at Montclair Public Library involved and perhaps still involves sitting in a wheelchair and navigating the library from it (Hutchinson, 2001, p. 78), a practice which people with disabilities find offensive and which implies that having to sit in a wheelchair can give an able-bodied person an accurate understanding of having a disability (Charles, 2005, p. 454). These attempts were well-intentioned, but there is no reason to rely on the guidance of others when a library can receive training from people with disabilities themselves. </p>
    <p>In the same way that testing for accessibility is best done by those with disabilities, a library wondering how to serve patrons with disabilities should ask them first. Rather than viewing disability as a problem and accessibility as an item to check off a list, libraries can become a force for justice by honoring the experience and opinions of people with disabilities (Kumbier & Starkey, 2016, p. 485). One such research project carried out at Lamar University sought to understand the way their Deaf and Hard of Hearing students used and were informed about the reference services offered at the Mary and John Gray Library. Rather than putting a program together from others’ opinions and settling for being ADA compliant, Saar and Arthur-Okor (2013) wanted to center their research on their patrons, finding out, among other things, that many were unaware of the ASL interpreters that the library offered. The authors note that their method had two benefits: “This act of reaching out to the university's Deaf community not only gave the library greater awareness of their needs, but also communicated to these students that the library values their contributions to the university and their presence” (Saar & Arthur-Okor, 2013, p. 445). There is no better method for understanding the effectiveness of a library’s services than to survey those that the services are meant for. </p>
<b>Staffing</b>
        <p>While libraries must pursue accessibility in their buildings and digital materials, they also must work to remove the barriers that prevent people with disabilities from accessing librarianship. The American Community survey found that among those that are likely to be working, between 6% (those aged 18 to 34) and 13% (35 to 64) reported having a disability (Bialik, 2017). Yet librarians with disabilities make up only an estimated 3.7% of American librarians (Oud, 2018, p. 2). This is a relatively substantial minority, and while there are scholarships to encourage people with disabilities to pursue librarianship, the percentage of librarians with disabilities is clearly low.  </p>
        <p>Those who have become librarians still face barriers to equality. They might have to suffer ableist reactions from patrons and others when they simply relating their profession, such as a laughing, “Whoever heard of a blind librarian? How can [you] find books or use traditional reference tools, if [you] cannot see?” (Lewis & Klauber, 2002). While there is little a library can do for their librarians besides supporting them in these cases, there are many ways to improve the working lives of librarians with disabilities. For instance, in an interview with Hunter (2016), Janice Rosen, a librarian who is hearing impaired, calls for “‘more opportunities for librarians with disabilities to participate in mentorship programs and . . . more information on resources for assistive technology that can be used by library students and library professionals who have disabilities’” (p. 16).  </p>
        <p>Many librarians keep their disabilities to themselves and/or refrain from requesting legal accommodation due to fear of it negatively affecting the way their supervisor, coworkers, and patrons would view them (Oud, 2018, p. 8). If the library is repeatedly centering the experience of patrons with disabilities in their planning, this may reassure librarians with disabilities that they can ask for what they need. More pressing is the fact that when Oud (2018) surveyed twelve academic librarians with disabilities who requested accommodation from their supervisors, 51% reported that it was granted only partially or not at all, and 75% reported experiencing negative consequences (p. 9). While the sample size of this research is small, it is nonetheless worrying. Libraries cannot claim to be a shining example of accessibility and inclusion if librarians are not granted necessary and legal accommodation. The fact that librarians with disabilities, while close to average in their job satisfaction, find their workplaces less inclusive and are less satisfied with accessibility and disability awareness means that libraries are likely not listening to their employees’ opinions or concerns, even in situations when they are the most knowledgeable (Oud, 2018, p. 11). Policies, compliancy, and disability-centered programming will be seen as an empty gesture if people with disabilities are not treated justly within librarianship. </p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
        <p>While it is a fact that libraries started offering services to people with disabilities a long time ago, that does not mean that they have nothing to learn. Compliance with ADA-mandated physical and digital accessibility is vital, as well as legal accommodation of librarians with disabilities. Additionally, libraries must make the needs of patrons and librarians with disabilities central to their planning. Assessment and training should be done by individuals with disabilities rather than an able-bodied “expert.” Offering physical and digital access to all patrons is an ongoing commitment rather than a checklist. Libraries have begun to move from compliance and service to centering the knowledge and experience of people with disabilities, but this change requires dedication and a willingness to admit mistakes. Becoming a force for justice in this way requires considering the needs of people with disabilities at the start, rather than treating accessibility as an afterthought. </p>
