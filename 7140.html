<h1 class="greeting">Advanced Reference Reflective Essay</h1>
<b>Introduction</b>
    <p>Reference librarianship has changed much since the creation and subsequent ubiquity of the internet, specifically because of the power and ease of use of Google, as well as the breadth and growing reliability of Wikipedia. This has led to concern over whether reference librarians (and libraries in general) have anything to offer their patrons and that they may become obsolete. The truth is that reference librarians (and libraries in general) are accustomed to changing to stay relevant, while the level of transformation required here is notable. Reference librarianship is just as alive today as it always has been and can remain so if it continues to concentrate on the realities of the present as well as the possibilities of the future. The main core of excellent reference librarianship has not changed, however, being formed by the value placed with purposeful equality on both the seekers and the information sought. </p>
<b>Present Realities</b>
    <p>Libraries cannot function if they do not understand the realities of the present. Of course, each library has its own community and context and therefore its own specific version of reality. As Cassell (2017) explains, “there is no one right way forward. Nevertheless, it is important to continually evaluate . . . whether our reference services reflect the needs of our patron groups” (p. 1-2). For example, a library considers how to offer its reference services: in some libraries, most patrons might prefer to use their email services, leading to what was once the reference desk being combined with general information, while other libraries may find that their patrons still make frequent requests in person. Yet few libraries would not benefit from some expansion of face-to-face interviews, offering reference services by chat, email, or text.  </p>
    <p>Additionally, libraries must be aware of the reality (both present and future) that they are not perfect. While passionate about the purpose of reference services, librarians should know that the lofty ideals are simply that: ideals. Thankfully, the American Library Association (ALA) shows what this awareness might look like in its frank inclusion of standards such as "Recognize when personal and professional limitations warrant the referral of a constituent to another resource and skillfully execute such referrals" and "Employ effective strategies for confronting librarian and library staff remarks, attitudes, and behaviors that insult, devalue, or demean constituents or their culture" in their 2012 Diversity Standards. By refusing to shy away from their own flaws, a reference librarian will be able to stay humble and work to be a more equitable conduit of information. </p>
<b>Future Possibilities</b>
    <p>Libraries are often balanced on the cutting edge of technology and trends, and reference services are no different. In order to meet patrons where they are, reference librarians should be aware of where they might be in the near future: often the next big thing was present for a few years before it became well known, and if a librarian can begin understanding it before everyone wants it, this allows them to offer something useful and immediately usable. Additionally, reference librarians should come up with their own ideas of how to increase knowledge and solve problems, pushing the limits of what defines reference services. In the same way that makerspaces became a new way for a library to offer a community space in which to increase technical knowledge, beta spaces are still-emerging way for a library to offer reference services. Beta spaces allow patrons to experiment with ideas, both with librarians and with each other. They are “designed to facilitate knowledge creation in real-time through user participation and experimentation” (Dickerson, 2016), which of course makes them risky. Yet what new endeavor at a library, even the most sedate of book clubs, does not include an element of risk? </p>
    <p>While beta spaces are a new direction for the physical library, reference librarians can and should push the limits on their virtual presence as well. One excellent example of this is the work of Joorabchi & Mahdi (2018) who mapped library subject headings to Wikipedia articles. Rather than viewing Wikipedia as a rival, threatening to steal away the library’s patrons and demolish their reference services, they looked to create “a bi-directional link and flow of information and users between the Wikipedia and libraries. This would enable information seekers to start their search activities from either of these sources and traverse back and forth as needed” (Joorabchi & Madhi, 2018, p. 59). While still being developed, this inventive connection has the potential to harness Wikipedia to increase library use, as well as helping library patrons to understand the available resources. </p>
<b>Valuing Seekers</b>
    <p>To maintain excellent reference services, the library must demonstrate care for the seekers. By being aware of their own biases and the cultural context of those biases, a reference librarian shows how much value they place on the seekers they assist. There is a digital divide which has created barriers for some seekers, to such an extent that they stop actively seeking altogether. Without an awareness of this issue, reference librarians cannot offer equitable service. One such group affected by the digital divide are those aged 65 and older, who have a much lower rate of internet use than any other group: 57% compared to the next nearest at 88% (Pew Research Center as quoted in Stanziano, 2016). Reference librarians, unfortunately, are not able to simply erase the digital divide. However, they can attempt to increase the comfort level the senior citizens of their communities have with computer and internet use through offering classes, as well as keeping in mind that those over 65 may prefer a physical resource to a digital one. </p>
    <p>Whether a patron is affected by the digital divide or not, all seekers deserve to be shown respect. One way for reference librarians to be sure that each seeker feels valued is through a pursuit of cultural competency. As Ouvrard-Prettol (2017) explains, “Cultural competence encompasses both an intrinsic personal desire to know others and a behavioral change to make it happen” (p. 27). Through developing an understanding of their own culture and how it drives their behavior, reference librarians can more easily see the way other cultures and values have not been given equal standing. This enables them to renew their focus on their communities as well as creating the foundations of long-term relationships with community members of other cultures. </p>
    <p>At the same time, valuing seekers does not require reference librarians to work without any boundaries. Especially when using virtual reference services, patrons may use inappropriate language when upset or even use the services to be purposefully provocative. Whether the seeker is in the library building or not, they still need to follow the rules about proper behavior. Placing value on the seeker’s needs does not mean continuing to try to assist “patrons whose language or behavior is offensive, abusive, or insulting, including communication of a sexual or too personal nature” (QuestionPoint, 2009). By putting up boundaries to show what behavior is unacceptable, reference librarians cultivate a healthy environment in which seekers can receive information. Reference librarians should keep in mind that not every uncomfortable interaction comes from a place of intentional rudeness. By remaining professional and gently reminding patrons of the expectations before terminating the interview, reference librarians will be able to redirect those patrons who might have difficulty communicating. </p>    
<b>Valuing Information</b>
    <p>If a reference librarian does not value the information that they are providing access to, there is clearly little point in their remaining a reference librarian. Reference collections should be regularly assessed for currency and accuracy, and reference librarians should stay up to date on databases as well as data trends. In addition to this, reference librarians can show the importance they place on information by looking to include instruction whenever possible. An increase in knowledge is always a positive for reference work, so a patron knowing not only where to look at the end of the interview, but how to look, is a worthy goal. Not every seeker will respond well to instruction, but reference librarians should be on the lookout for those that might. In addition to these one-on-one interactions, reference librarians can offer classes that promote information literacy. While we are all receiving information almost nonstop due to our use of social media and other websites, many are not fully information-literate and are not even aware of this. Yet we have some awareness that it is a concern due to the new phrase and resurging phenomenon of fake news. To combat this, many libraries, such as the St. Tammany Parish Library with its “Fact or Fake? Learn to Tell Real Information from the Scams” (Ireland, 2017, p.14), offer classes specifically instructing patrons how not to be taken in online. </p>
    <p>Few things are as vital to showing the value placed on information than the work of assessment. Assessing collections, services, and programs is not an easy task. In order for the assessment to be truly useful, it requires serious time and effort. An excellent reference librarian will work slowly through the assessment, perhaps planning it out with use of Zabel & Reiter’s (2020) framework, which involves four main decisions: what will be the goals, assessment question(s), evidence, and assessment method? It will likely require a mixed method approach, as all methods have some downside to them. Reference librarians must remember that without assessment, they cannot be confident that their collection, services, or programs are truly current, accurate, and accessible. The work is certainly worth it. </p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
    <p>No reference librarian is perfect, but despite the despair that accompanied the ubiquity of Google and Wikipedia, no reference librarian needs to be concerned about becoming obsolete. By staying alert about present realities and future possibilities, reference librarians will continue to be relevant. By demonstrating equal care for both seekers and information, reference librarians will continue to be necessary. The world of reference librarianship has been one of transformation, but its core – providing access to all – remains unchanged. </p>
