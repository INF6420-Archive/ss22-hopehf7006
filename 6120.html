<b>“Cool Off with a Trip to the North” Book Display </b>
<p>Based on <i>Arctic Dreams</i> by Barry Lopez, this display of nonfiction books about the Arctic is perfect for a summer spent at home. I focused on the following aspects of Arctic Dreams: a setting central to the story, poetic and scientific language, and a variety of characters and stories. Each book would have a short write-up, and the display itself would be decorated with plenty of snowflakes. </p>
<ol>
    <li><i>A Woman in the Polar Night</i> by Christiane Ritter
        <p>In this 1938 memoir, an Austrian painter recounts her year spent on the island of Spitsbergen in a hut with her husband with wit and awe. Though isolated, endangered, and often underfed, Ritter can’t help but fall under the spell of Arctic wonder. </p></li>
    <li><i>Names for the Sea</i> by Sarah Moss
        <p>Sarah Moss has dreamed of living in Iceland since summering there as a teenager, so on a whim she applies for a position at the University of Iceland despite her comfortable English life with her family. Amid economic crisis and a volcanic eruption, Moss becomes enchanted with the people and nature of the chilly island, both strange and wonderful.  </p></li>
    <li><i>The Museum of Whales You Will Never See</i> by A. Kendra Greene
        <p>Iceland has a wealth, even a surplus, of museums: 1 for every 10 of its population of 330,000, and A. Kendra Greene takes you on a dreamlike journey through the Arctic past and present as she guides us from the Phallological Museum to the Museum of Sorcery and Witchcraft. </p></li>
    <li><i>An African in Greenland</i> by Tété-Michel Kpomassie
        <p>It’s more than 4,750 miles from Togo to Greenland, but for Tété-Michel Kpomassie, it was a painless journey to leave his African birthplace in the 1960s to pursue his lifelong Arctic dream. Welcomed warmly by the Inuit, endlessly curious about the country he now called home, Kpomassie introduces the rest of the world to what was only a mystery at the time. </p></li>
    <li><i>This Cold Heaven</i> by Gretel Ehrlich
        <p>As Gretel Ehrlich tells the story of her travels through Greenland, her obsession for nine years, she also tells the story of the island itself, delving into its rich history and anthropology. Through her eyes, the icy wilderness becomes a fount of wisdom and peace. </p></li>
    <li><i>True North</i> by Gavin Francis
        <p>In this investigation of Arctic Europe, Gavin Francis covers almost as much ground geographically and he does metaphorically, revealing the present, history, and mythology of every country from the Shetland Islands to Lapland. </p></li>
    <li><i>The Magnetic North</i> by Sara Wheeler
        <p>Travel to the farthest north one can be with Sara Wheeler as she recounts her voyage spiraling out from the North Pole through the fringes of Russia, the United States, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, exploring a tapestry of people and cultures bound together in the cold. </p></li>
    <li><i>The Ice Balloon</i> by Alec Wilkinson
        <p>After explorers like Robert Peary and Frederick Cook fought to become the first person to reach the North Pole, S. A. Andrée decided to float there in a hydrogen balloon, gaining international fame at the time but all but forgotten now. Alec Wilkinson reintroduces us to this remarkable expedition in this well-researched and captivating book. </p></li>
    <li><i>Saqiyuq </i> by Nancy Wachowich, Apphia Agalakti Awa, Rhoda Kaukjak Katsak, and Sandra Pikujak Katsak
        <p>Named for a strong wind that suddenly shifts direction, this generational memoir follows three women from childhood to raising their own children in the swiftly changing Arctic of the 20th Century. Apphia Awa, born in 1931, lives in a pre-colonial Nunavat; her daughter Rhoda Katsak grows up attending government schools; Sandra Katsak deals with the complexity of a Western settlement. </p></li>
