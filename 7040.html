<h1 class="greeting">Management Case Study</h1>
    <p>When discussing the case study of the flu vaccine requirement at Consolidated Corporation, my group concluded that the library director must balance carrying out the mandate given to them by the president and minimizing the damage stemming from the two paraprofessionals, Ms. Johnson and Mr. Smith. We came to this conclusion through an unstructured discussion in which each group member was given time to state their views and respond to others, and I am in complete agreement with it. </p>
<b>Up the Chain</b>
    <p>When discussing this case study, my group came up with a few actions for the library director that involve communication up the chain of command. We believe the library director should inform the legal team of Consolidated Corporation of the conversations they had with Ms. Johnson and Mr. Smith, so that they are aware of their intent to sue the company if and when they are fired. One member of the group noted that when writing the memo or email, special attention should be paid to Mr. Smith, whose religious beliefs have more weight under the law. </p>
    <p>We also discussed other options for the library director. For instance, the library director might inquire whether current employees who accepted their positions before this mandate was created be “grandfathered in,” or, considering that this mandate was a response to the insurance company that carries Consolidated health plans, perhaps employees could be exempted if they dropped out of that plan and found their own. The first option was rejected because this would mean that all employees could be exempted, which goes against the mandate entirely. However, we agreed that the second option would be worth discussing with the legal team. </p>
    <p>We also agreed that this mandate was given out with no warning, which may have contributed to Ms. Johnson and Mr. Smith’s dissatisfaction. Another option for the library director would be to inquire whether there might still be team to have an informational meeting in which employees could ask questions and voice their concerns. </p>
<b>Down the Chain</b>
    <p>There are also options for the library director that involve communication down the chain of command. Although there is only a week until the vaccines are given and, likely, when those refusing will be terminated, there is the possibility of Ms. Johnson and Mr. Smith directly sabotaging their work or working poorly due to their feelings of being treated unfairly. The library director should therefore de-escalate as much as possible. By reassuring them that their voices are being heard while sincerely advocating for them, the library director should be able to prevent any serious in-house repercussions. It may be possible to counsel them, especially Ms. Johnson, to accept the termination without a suit or even the vaccination itself. </p>
    <p>Additionally, we discussed that the library director may want to consider how important these paraprofessionals are to the team. No matter what, their concerns should be addressed respectfully and forwarded to the legal team, but if they have caused problems in the past, it may be wiser to mitigate the termination rather than trying to stop it. On the other hand, if one or both of them are, to the library director, the most trusted and valuable member of the team, they may want to work to find a possible exemption and spend more significant time giving them counsel. </p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
    <p>Although the library director is stuck between the president who created the flu vaccine mandate and the paraprofessionals who have rejected it, that does not mean that they are without options. I agreed with the conclusion my group reached, that the director should keep their team from imploding as much as possible while continuing to carry out the mandate. </p>
